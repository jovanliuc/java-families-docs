# Overview
> Here are some Java basic interview questions 
> and their answers:

# List of Content
## 1. What is Java?
> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language 
> that was designed to be platform-independent and easily portable.

## 2. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
> JDK stands for Java Development Kit 
> and includes tools for developing 
> and compiling Java code. 
> JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment 
> and is used to run Java applications. 
> JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine 
> and is responsible for executing Java bytecode.

## 3. What are the main features of Java?
> Some main features of Java include 
> platform independence, object-oriented programming, 
> multithreading, automatic garbage collection, 
> and built-in exception handling.

## 4. What is an Object in Java?
> An object is an instance of a class 
> that has its own set of properties and methods.

## 5. What is a Class in Java?
> A class is a blueprint or template 
> for creating objects that defines the properties 
> and methods of the object.

## 6. What is Inheritance in Java?
> Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming 
> that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, 
> inheriting its properties and methods.

## 7. What is Polymorphism in Java?
> Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming 
> that allows objects of different classes to be treated 
> as if they are of the same type.

## 8. What is Encapsulation in Java?
> Encapsulation is a feature of object-oriented programming 
> that involves hiding the implementation details 
> of an object and providing access to its properties 
> and methods only through a public interface.

## 9. What is Abstraction in Java?
> Abstraction is a feature of object-oriented programming 
> that involves defining the essential characteristics 
> of an object and ignoring the non-essential details.

## 10. What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface in Java?
> An abstract class can have both concrete 
> and abstract methods, 
> while an interface can only have abstract methods. 
> Additionally, a class can only extend one abstract class, 
> but can implement multiple interfaces.

## 11. What is the difference between a Compiler and an Interpreter in Java?
> A compiler translates source code into machine code, 
> while an interpreter executes code directly.

## 12. What is the difference between a String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in Java?
> A String is an immutable sequence of characters, 
> while a StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable sequences 
> of characters. StringBuilder is not thread-safe, 
> while StringBuffer is thread-safe.

## 13. What is a Package in Java?
> A package is a collection of related classes 
> and interfaces that provide a namespace for organizing code 
> and avoiding naming conflicts.

## 14. What is a Constructor in Java?
> A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object 
> when it is created.

## 15. What is the difference between an instance variable and a static variable in Java?
> An instance variable is associated with a specific 
> instance of a class and has a different value for each instance, 
> while a static variable is associated with the class itself 
> and has the same value for all instances of the class.
