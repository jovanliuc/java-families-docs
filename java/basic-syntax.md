# Overview
> Here are some basic Java syntax rules:

# List Of Content
## 1. Java code is case-sensitive.

## 2. The code is written in classes.

## 3. Each statement must end with a semicolon `;`.

## 4. Java comments start with `//` for single-line comments, or `/`and end with `/` for multi-line comments.

## 5. Java uses the curly brace `{}` to define the scope of methods and classes.

## 6. The main method is the entry point of a Java program and is defined as follows:
> ```java
> public static void main(String[] args) {
>   // code goes here
> }
> ```

## 7. To declare a variable, use the data type followed by the variable name, and optionally an initial value:
> ```java
> int num = 10;
> String message = "Hello, World!";
> ```

## 8. To output a message to the console, use the `System.out.println()` method:
> ```java
> System.out.println("Hello, World!");
> ```

## 9. To get input from the user, use the Scanner class:
> ```java
> import java.util.Scanner;
> Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
> String name = scanner.nextLine();
> ```
