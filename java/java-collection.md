# Java Collection Overview
Java Collection Framework is a set of classes 
and interfaces in Java that provide an architecture 
to store and manipulate groups of objects. 
The Java Collection Framework contains interfaces 
and classes that represent different types
of collections like List, Set, Queue, Map, etc. 
These collections can be used to store 
and manipulate different types of data in Java.

Here are some of the key interfaces and classes 
in the Java Collection Framework:

> - Collection: This is the root interface 
> of the collection hierarchy. 
> It represents a group of objects known as elements. 
> It defines the basic operations like add, remove, 
> and contains that all collections should support.
> - List: This is an ordered collection 
> that allows duplicate elements.
> It provides operations like add, remove, get, 
> and set.
> - Set: This is an unordered collection 
> that does not allow duplicate elements.
> It provides operations like add, remove,
> and contains.
> - Map: This is a collection of key-value pairs, 
> where each key must be unique. 
> It provides operations like put, get, remove,
> and containsKey.
> - Queue: This is a collection used 
> to hold elements prior to processing. 
> It supports operations like add, remove, 
> and element.

There are other specialized collections
like SortedSet, SortedMap, Deque, etc. 
that provide additional functionality.

Java Collection Framework provides a rich set of APIs
to manipulate collections. 
It provides various algorithms like sorting, 
searching, shuffling, etc. that can be applied
to collections. It also provides utility classes 
like Collections and Arrays that provide various methods
to work with collections and arrays.

Overall, Java Collection Framework provides a powerful 
and flexible way to work with collections 
of data in Java.
