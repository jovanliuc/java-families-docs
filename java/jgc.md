# Java Garbage Collector
In Java, the garbage collector is responsible for 
automatically freeing up memory that is no longer being used by the program. 
This is a very important feature, 
as it helps prevent memory leaks 
and other memory-related issues.

The garbage collector works 
by periodically scanning the program's memory
and identifying objects that are no longer being used.
These objects are then marked as garbage 
and can be safely removed from memory.
The process of identifying and removing garbage 
is known as garbage collection.

Java's garbage collector uses a variety of algorithms
to perform garbage collection, including:
1. Mark and sweep: This algorithm scans the entire heap 
and marks all objects that are still in use. 
It then frees up all memory that is not marked.
2. Copying: This algorithm divides the heap into two equal parts, 
and each time it runs, it copies all live objects 
from one part to the other, 
freeing up the first part.
3. Generational: This algorithm divides the heap into multiple generations, 
with new objects being allocated in the youngest generation. 
The garbage collector then scans only the youngest generation,
freeing up memory that is no longer being used.
Older generations are scanned less frequently.

Java provides several options for tuning the garbage collector, 
depending on the specific needs of the program. 
These options can be set using command-line parameters 
or through configuration files.
