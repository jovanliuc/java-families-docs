# JVM Introduction

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software 
that executes Java bytecode. 
When a Java program is compiled, 
the resulting bytecode is not machine code 
that can be directly executed by the computer's processor. 
Instead, it is a set of instructions 
that can only be understood by the JVM.

The JVM serves as a runtime environment for Java programs,
providing a layer of abstraction between the program 
and the underlying hardware. 
When a Java program is run, 
the JVM loads the bytecode and executes it, 
translating the bytecode into machine code 
that can be executed by the computer's processor.

The JVM is designed to be platform-independent, 
which means that Java programs can run on any platform
that has a compatible JVM installed.
This is because the JVM provides a consistent runtime environment, 
regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.

In addition to executing Java bytecode, 
the JVM also provides other features, 
such as automatic memory management (through garbage collection) 
and security mechanisms (such as the Java Security Manager).

Different implementations of the JVM exist, 
including Oracle's HotSpot JVM, OpenJDK, 
and IBM's J9 JVM. 
These implementations can differ in their performance characteristics and features, 
but they all conform to the Java Virtual Machine Specification, 
which defines the standard for JVM behavior.
