# The Overview of Data Structure & Algorithm
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental 
concepts in computer science and programming. 
They are essential for developing efficient 
and effective software solutions.

A data structure is a way of organizing and 
storing data in a computer program so that 
it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently.
It provides a logical representation of data 
items and their relationships to one another. 
Examples of commonly used data structures 
include arrays, linked lists, stacks, 
queues, trees, and graphs.

Algorithms are a set of step-by-step instructions 
used to solve a particular problem or perform 
a specific task. They are a sequence of well-defined 
steps that can be followed to complete a particular task. 
Examples of algorithms include sorting algorithms,
searching algorithms, and graph traversal algorithms.

Data structures and algorithms are closely related
because the choice of data structure can affect 
the efficiency of an algorithm. For example,
searching for an element in an unsorted array 
takes linear time, whereas searching for an element
in a sorted array takes logarithmic time. 
Therefore, choosing the right data structure can make 
a big difference in the efficiency of an algorithm.

Some key concepts related to data structures and algorithms include:

1. Time complexity: the amount of time an algorithm 
takes to run as a function of the size of its input.

2. Space complexity: the amount of memory an algorithm 
requires as a function of the size of its input.

3. Big O notation: a way of describing the time 
complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input.

4. Recursion: a technique for solving problems by 
breaking them down into smaller sub-problems.

5. Dynamic programming: a technique for solving problems 
by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and 
storing the solutions to these sub-problems to 
avoid redundant computation.

6. Greedy algorithms: a technique for solving optimization
problems by making locally optimal choices at each step.

7. Divide and conquer: a technique for solving problems
by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems, 
solving each sub-problem independently, and then 
combining the solutions to solve the original problem.

Overall, data structures and algorithms are essential
for developing efficient and effective software solutions, 
and understanding their concepts and implementations 
is crucial for any programmer or computer scientist.

# Types of Algorithms
There are several types of algorithms available. 
Some important algorithms are:

1. Brute Force Algorithm: It is the simplest approach 
for a problem. A brute force algorithm is the first
approach that comes to finding when we see a problem.

2. Recursive Algorithm: A recursive algorithm is
based on recursion. In this case, a problem is 
broken into several sub-parts and called the same
function again and again.

3. Backtracking Algorithm: The backtracking algorithm 
basically builds the solution by searching among 
all possible solutions. Using this algorithm, 
we keep on building the solution following criteria.
Whenever a solution fails we trace back to the failure 
point and build on the next solution and continue 
this process till we find the solution or all 
possible solutions are looked after.

4. Searching Algorithm: Searching algorithms are the ones 
that are used for searching elements or groups of elements 
from a particular data structure. They can be of different
types based on their approach or the data structure in 
which the element should be found.

5. Sorting Algorithm: Sorting is arranging a group of data 
in a particular manner according to the requirement. 
The algorithms which help in performing this function 
are called sorting algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms
are used to sort groups of data in an increasing 
or decreasing manner.

6. Hashing Algorithm: Hashing algorithms work similarly to 
the searching algorithm. But they contain an index with
a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data.

7. Divide and Conquer Algorithm: This algorithm breaks a problem 
into sub-problems, solves a single sub-problem and merges 
the solutions together to get the final solution. 
It consists of the following three steps:
   - Divide
   - Solve
   - Combine

8. Greedy Algorithm: In this type of algorithm the solution
is built part by part. The solution of the next part 
is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part. 
The one solution giving the most benefit will be chosen 
as the solution for the next part.

9. Dynamic Programming Algorithm: This algorithm uses the 
concept of using the already found solution to avoid 
repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem.
It divides the problem into smaller overlapping 
sub-problems and solves them.

10. Randomized Algorithm: In the randomized algorithm 
we use a random number, so it gives immediate benefit.
The random number helps in deciding the expected outcome.
