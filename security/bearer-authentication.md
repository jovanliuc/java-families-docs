# Bearer Authentication
Bearer authentication is a type of authentication scheme 
used in web applications and APIs to secure access 
to protected resources. It is widely used in token-based
authentication systems, where a token is issued to a 
client upon successful authentication, and that token 
is then used to authorize subsequent requests.

Here's how bearer authentication typically works:

1. Authentication: The client sends its credentials 
(such as a username and password) to the authentication server.
2. Token Generation: If the credentials are valid, 
the authentication server generates a token for the client.
3. Token Issuance: The server sends the token back to the client.
4. Authorization: The client includes the token in the 
Authorization header of subsequent requests to the protected resource.
5. Resource Access: The server receives the request
and verifies the token's validity and permissions.
6. Response: If the token is valid and authorized, 
the server responds with the requested resource.

Bearer tokens are usually long, random strings, 
and they don't inherently contain any information about
the user or their permissions. The token itself serves 
as proof of authentication and authorization. 
Since bearer tokens can grant access to sensitive 
information, they need to be kept secure and protected
against unauthorized access.

It's important to note that bearer tokens are typically 
transmitted over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between the client 
and server, reducing the risk of interception and 
unauthorized access to the token.

Bearer authentication is commonly used in `OAuth 2.0`,
a widely adopted protocol for granting access to 
third-party applications without exposing the user's 
credentials. It allows users to grant specific permissions
to external applications by providing them with a bearer
token issued by the OAuth server.

Overall, bearer authentication provides a flexible 
and widely supported method for securing access to 
resources in web applications and APIs, making it a
popular choice in many authentication systems.
