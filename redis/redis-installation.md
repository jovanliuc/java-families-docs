# Redis Installation on Mac OS X
Here's how you can install Redis on macOS:

1. **Install Homebrew**: Homebrew is a popular
package manager for macOS. To install it, 
open a Terminal window and run the following command:
    ```shell
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    
    ```

2. **Install Redis**: Once Homebrew is installed, 
you can use it to install Redis by running the following command:
    ```shell
    brew install redis
    ```

3. **Start Redis**: After the installation is complete, 
you can start Redis using the following command:
    ```shell
    brew services start redis
    ```
    This will start Redis as a background service, 
    which means it will run automatically every time
    you start your computer.

4. **Test Redis**: You can test if Redis is working correctly
by running the following command:
    ```shell
    redis-cli ping
    ```
    If Redis is running correctly, it should respond with PONG.

That's it! Redis should now be installed and running
on your macOS system. You can use Redis by connecting
to it using a Redis client, such as redis-cli.
