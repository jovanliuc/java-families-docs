Redis supports the following data types:

1. **Strings**: The most basic data type in Redis, 
used to store any kind of text or binary data,
such as serialized objects, JSON, or plain text.

2. **Lists**: A collection of ordered strings, similar 
to a linked list, that supports push and pop 
operations on both ends.

3. **Sets**: An unordered collection of unique strings,
which can be used to perform set operations such 
as union, intersection, and difference.

4. **Sorted sets**: A set that is ordered by a score associated
with each member. This data type is useful for 
scenarios that require ranking, such as leaderboards
or top scores.

5. **Hashes**: A collection of key-value pairs, where each
key maps to a value. This data type is useful for 
storing objects that have multiple fields.

6. **Bitmaps**: A data type that can represent a set of
bits, which can be manipulated using bitwise operations.

7. **HyperLogLogs**: A probabilistic data structure used
to estimate the cardinality of a set, using a small 
amount of memory.

8. **Geospatial indexes**: A data type that can store 
geographical locations and perform operations 
such as distance calculation and radius queries.

9. **Streams**: A data type that represents a sequence 
of messages, where each message is a key-value pair. 
This data type is useful for implementing message 
queues, event sourcing, and other streaming scenarios.

10. **Redis Modules**: Redis also supports extensions through
Redis Modules, which can introduce new data types
and commands. Some popular Redis modules include 
RediSearch for full-text search, RedisGraph for graph
data processing, and RedisTimeSeries for time-series 
data.

Each data type has its own set of operations and 
commands in Redis, allowing developers to choose 
the most appropriate data type for their use case.
