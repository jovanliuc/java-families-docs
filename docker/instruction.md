# The Overview of Docker
Docker is a popular platform for building,
shipping, and running applications in containers. 
Containers are lightweight and portable environments
that can package code and dependencies together,
making it easy to deploy applications across 
different environments without worrying about 
the underlying infrastructure.

With Docker, developers can create and manage 
container images that contain everything needed 
to run their application, including the code, 
libraries, and configuration files. These images
can then be shared and reused, making it easier 
to collaborate on projects and deploy applications 
to production.

Docker provides a simple and consistent way to
manage containers, and it works across multiple
operating systems and cloud platforms. 
It also provides a rich ecosystem of tools and services,
including Docker Hub for sharing and discovering 
container images, Docker Compose for managing 
multi-container applications, and Docker Swarm for
orchestrating container clusters.

Overall, Docker is a powerful tool for building 
and deploying applications in containers, 
and it has become an essential part of modern software
development and deployment workflows.
