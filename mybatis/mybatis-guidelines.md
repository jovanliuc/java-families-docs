# The Overview of MyBatis Guidelines
Here are some guidelines for working with MyBatis:

1. Use a clear and consistent naming convention for 
your SQL queries and result maps. This will make it
easier to understand and maintain your code.

2. Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
MyBatis provides built-in support for this.

3. Use annotations or XML configuration files to map your
Java objects to database tables. Annotations can be 
more concise, while XML configuration files offer more
flexibility.

4. Avoid complex SQL queries in your code. Instead, use stored 
procedures or views to encapsulate complex logic and reduce
the amount of code that needs to be maintained.

5. Use MyBatis's caching features to improve performance. 
MyBatis provides several levels of caching, including 
session-level and statement-level caching.

6. Use transactions to ensure data consistency. MyBatis 
supports both programmatic and declarative transaction 
management.

7. Use MyBatis's dynamic SQL features to create dynamic queries
based on user input. This can make your code more flexible
and adaptable.

8. Use MyBatis's logging features to troubleshoot issues. 
MyBatis provides built-in logging that can be configured
to output detailed information about SQL queries and other
actions.

9. Keep your SQL code separate from your Java code. This will
make it easier to modify your SQL queries and maintain your code.

10. Finally, follow best practices for Java programming, such as
using object-oriented design principles, following naming 
conventions, and writing readable and maintainable code.
