# The Overview of ADFS
ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services) is a component 
of Microsoft's identity and access management solution. 
It provides single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity 
functionality, allowing users to authenticate and access 
multiple applications and services using a single set 
of credentials.

ADFS enables organizations to establish trust relationships
with other trusted entities, such as partner organizations
or cloud service providers. It uses industry-standard protocols, 
such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OAuth,
to facilitate secure authentication and authorization processes.

With ADFS, users can log in once to their organization's 
identity provider (IdP) and then access various applications 
or services without the need to re-enter their credentials. 
It eliminates the need for separate usernames and passwords 
for each application, simplifying the user experience and 
improving security by centralizing authentication.

ADFS also supports claims-based authentication, where user 
attributes and permissions are expressed as claims.
These claims can be used to make authorization decisions
and control access to resources based on the user's attributes.

Overall, ADFS helps organizations establish trust, enable SSO,
and enable federated identity across different systems and 
services, providing a seamless and secure user experience.
